# .development/ - Development Documentation

Private development documentation for spec-driven development workflow.

**Committed to git** - shared development documentation.

## Quick Start

1. Read `CURRENT-STATUS.md` for project state
2. Read `INDEX.md` for full navigation (auto-generated)
3. Check `tech-debt/` for active issues

## Structure

## Workflow

### Tech Debt

```
1. Create: tech-debt/issue-name.md (use _TEMPLATE.md)
2. Work: Update notes, track progress
3. Resolve: Change status to "resolved"
4. Archive: Move to archive/completed/
```

### Architecture Decisions (ADR)

Create in `reference/decisions/` when:
- Architectural pattern choice
- Technology selection
- Cross-cutting concern decision
- Trade-off impacting multiple components

Format: `NNN-descriptive-name.md`

### Agent Reports

Agents write to:
- Full report -> `archive/analysis/YYYY-MM-DD_report_agent-name.md`
- Critical findings -> `tech-debt/` as individual issues
